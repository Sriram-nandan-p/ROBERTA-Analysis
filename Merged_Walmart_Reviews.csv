The scent was so strong that I can smell it through the bottle and I just knew in my heart that this would be a disappointment. But I still wanted to try it out and to my surprise I actually ended up enjoying the Lavender Essential Oil. I struggle with falling asleep in a timely fashion so I used a cotton ball and just dabbed a drop or two on the back of my pillow and the aroma really did help sooth and relax me. Now I will say this, a major key will be to only use a little. The saying a little goes a long way applies really well with use of this product because over using can come off too strong. I also appreciate the fact that it is kid safe when diluted with water if you have a household with little ones. I am looking into purchasing a Plant Therapy Essential Oil Diffuser to see if or how I would be able to incorporate the essential oils into my nightly routines. I would totally recommend this product."

I used this along with a few drops of tea tree oil in my daughter's bath to help sooth her skin after a long day at the pool, and she slept through the night without waking due to itching and skin irritation that is caused by exposure to the chlorine. This oil has so many uses. I put a couple of drops in coconut oil as a hair mask for my dry scalp. Used it treat mosquito bites on my whole family and am also using it as a natural bug repellent. I canÕt wait to use this in my diffuser too. Great versatile oil that is highly concentrated so a little goes a long way.I will definitely buy again and again!"

When I came across this product, it caught my attention because it is 100% organic is Kidsafe, which is a bonus for me.I mainly decided this would be a great product to try because both my son and I are restless sleepers and I figured trying something natural to help us relax during the night would be a good idea. I poured two drops of the oil on a cotton ball and spread the lavender oil on my sons pillow. I was pretty shockes that it took him a shorter amount of time to fall asleep. Which as a mom it is such a great a relief when our children fall asleep without fighting. I even poured a few drops onto the AC filter in my room after finding the suggestion online. As soon as I tirned the AC on the lavender smell was so refreshing and soothing. I could honestly say that I had a goodnights sleep with the scent of the lavender blowing through the AC. I will definitely be purchasing Plant Therapy essential oils in the future. I would reccomend the Lavendar essential oil to buyers who are looking for natural ways to relieve stress and relax."

"Plant Therapy Lavender Essential Oil 100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade, Aromatherapy Diffuser for Relaxation and Body Care, Healthy Skin and Hair, 10 mL (1/3 oz)",https://www.walmart.com/reviews/product/149511265?page=46,4.9 out of 5,"I just recently got an essential oil diffuser and was excited to add lavender to my collection. Before a diffuser, I was using a nontoxic based essential oil lavender candle. So I have a high expectations when it comes to other lavender products. I was a little nervous that this wouldnÕt smell exactly how I expect lavender to smell, only because IÕve had that experience before with other things. Luckily, this essential oil from the bottle smells as itÕs advertised. I like how it states itÕs Òkid safe.Ó The bottle I got is a good starter size and is made of glass with a plastic top. An added bonus is that they put a purple ÒlavenderÓ label on top of the lid making it easy to identify out of my collection. Surprisingly, none of my other essential oils have this, so I always have to pick them up to see what oil it is. Great job Plant Therapy! On the back, the company even says how your can use your oil (a nice touch). When I pour the oil, it dispenses the drops at a consistent rate and doesnÕt run off the edge like other oils do. Once the lavender is diluted in water and diffused, it provides such a soothing atmosphere that immediately calms my body. The only thing that would make this even better is if it was certified organic. However, this isnÕt a dealbreaker for me and I believe Plant Therapy does have those options of organic."

My daughter gets pinkeye a couple times a year, it seems. It used to be so annoying to head to the doctor for every case of this, and get a prescription filled, and pour it in her eye, and quite often after the prescription was done, the pinkeye would come back. Now, I just use about a tablespoon of coconut oil mixed with a drop or two of lavender essential oil, mix them well, and put tiny bits of this around her eye (above, below, beside). This cures pinkeye faster than the prescriptions! And much cheaper and it is effective against both viral and bacterial strains (which prescriptions are not) and it doesn't worry me so much that I'm putting all this medicine into her, because it's all natural. I like buying directly from Plant Therapy, rather than through a large distributor like Walmart or Amazon where you can't be sure if you are getting the real thing or a fake. It's always great to support smaller companies as well. And I appreciate that Plant Therapy allows you to customize your order with the exact oils you most need and use, rather than forcing you to buy bundles of them like some of the other essential oil companies. I will be purchasing essential oils from Plant Therapy in the future."

From adding it to the laundry (no dryer sheets ever), to diffusing it with Cedarwood &amp; sweet orange for restful night, this one is a must have. I also use it in balms, lotions, or diluted to give my skin the benefits of the oil, which seems to help breakouts &amp; minor blemishes. I had previously been using another huge brand, and decided to give Plant Therapy a go after a recommendation from a trusted friend, &amp; my own (week long) searching of all the company's ins &amp; outs. My only qualm about this lavender is that is doesn't smell... the same, as my previous bottle. Almost like a musty version of what I'm used to. I can honestly say that, while I like it, I don't love it. I will, however, continue to use it, and will purchase again."

The customer service rep I spoke with said they would post it as soon as they can. I hope Plant Therapy is not selling oils before they have received an acceptable test report! My secondary concern: The bottle of lavender oil I received smelled horrible (completely unlike any lavender I have ever smelled before). I contacted customer service and was told I received a green batch. I will follow their instructions and store it for a couple months and hopefully the smell will drastically improve. In the meantime they sent me a complimentary replacement (reason for 2 stars instead of 1). I will update to 3 stars if this lavender does actually improve after sitting on the shelf for a couple months.

This oil has a pungent almost sour quality to it that made it hard for me to relax and enjoy the scent. It is still somewhat relaxing but because I dont enjoy the smell it doesnt make me feel content and at ease. This is Bulgarian lavender and Ive read that lavender from other countries like Hungary or Greece smell lighter so that may have been the kind of lavender I remember loving. I also did some research and found out that most lavender-scented products like lotions and candles smell much different than pure lavender oil. The lavender essential oil I had from a lower quality brand had a milder more flowery scent that I enjoyed more but I think this one is the better choice since its higher quality.

Lavender EO has become a wonderful addition to my meditation therapeutic touch massage and other holistic interventions to manage my anxiety. I use a pre-diluted roll-on applied to my wrists chest and behind my ears as a source of comfort at those times when anxiety is triggered. Ive also enjoyed diffusing lavender alone or with frankincense for a soothing calming environment.

The calming effect when used in aromatherapy is amazing. I let the scent in my area calm me soothe the emotions that seemingly are destroying the good day and then I realize the reason is the Lavender Oil in my diffuser. I was never a big believer in that before-back just a few years ago-but when you allow the aroma diffuser to do its thing you can better do yours. Then there is the assistance to easing the pain in my knees. I have arthritis and it can stop you cold but with the aroma therapy and application to my knees well I get back into the mainstream. You too can find it because Lavender has that effect on just about all who use it.

Idk what is in this oil there is something else added to it that makes the scent very overpowering and artificial smelling. Also I put a little bit of it on my lava rock bracelet and the smell would not go away even after I washed it with soap and water, and showered with it on 3 days in a row. I even accidentally washed my bracelet in the washing machine and it still smelled like fake lavender. I would look elsewhere if you wand a calm soothing lavender essential oil."

This time I wanted to get the same oil only in a smaller size to be able to carry it in my purse. When I saw that Plant Therapy was having a sale on lavender essential oils I ordered this one right away without realizing that this was NOT organic lavender essential oil. When it arrived I simply put it in my purse without testing it because I assumed it was the same oil that I already had at home. However when it came time to use it I noticed that the oils scent was very odd. It had a hint of bitterness in it and just didnt smell right. I thought this was a bit strange but didnt give it too much thought because I was in a hurry. The next time I reached for the bottle I noticed the same odd smell. This time I examined the bottle to make sure it was lavender oil and discovered to my dismay that this oil was not organic. I realized that I must have somehow overlooked this detail at the time of purchase. Still knowing that it came from Plant Therapy whose products I like and trust I decided to give this oil another chance so I tried it on yet another occasion. Unfortunately the bitterness was still present and it overpowered the scent that one normally associates with lavender. I dont know if it has to do with the type of lavender flowers collected for this oil or the distillation process but this oil in my opinion is inferior to the organic lavender oil sold by Plant Therapy. I would not recommend this oil for therapeutic use. I am very disappointed because now it is too late to return the product and I still need to buy a replacement organic lavender oil in a small bottle.

The calming effect when used in aromatherapy is amazing. I let the scent in my area calm me soothe the emotions that seemingly are destroying the good day and then I realize the reason is the Lavender Oil in my diffuser. I was never a big believer in that before-back just a few years ago-but when you allow the aroma diffuser to do its thing you can better do yours. Then there is the assistance to easing the pain in my knees. I have arthritis and it can stop you cold but with the aroma therapy and application to my knees well I get back into the mainstream. You too can find it because Lavender has that effect on just about all who use it.

The Plant Therapy lavender worked wonders. After she ran out she went to the store and found a different brand. She found that brand didn't smell as good or strong. So to always try to encourage people to use quality essential oils (and not ones that are fragrance oils) I bought a bottle for her. And this is the only lavender that I've been using for at least 5 years because I too think it has a wonderful smell and I know it works wonders!

I have purchased many bottles from PT and also have at least one type of lavender from 5 other reputable EO companies. They are all similar, but each one has it's own 'je ne sais quoi'. But this last batch of 30ml lavender from PT that I got is absolutely divine. It is probably the best smelling lavender of any company I have tried over the years, including all the past PT bottles i've gone through. CS confirmed it was a new batch and if you aren't sure you even need a new lavender, I recommend you get a bottle right now so you can experience this beautiful batch. It is less herbaceous and more sweet, more of the lavender fine or lavender diva scent profile. Floral and intoxicating. Anyways, I am obsessed and just bought another 30ml bottle so it will last (a little) longer!"

Once you learn they hike up the prices because they have to pay their sales people it makes sense why they are so expensive. Now that I have discovered plant therapy I will only purchase from them. It is the same quality if not better. I use this to diffuse as well as sleep. Put some on my palms and balls of my feet and it calms me down.

I purchased along with 5 other oils from Plant Therapy to make a blend for sleeping . I am new to essential oils and although I love the scents and their benefits I have also learned that many are highly toxic to cats; I won't be making as many future purchases as I had hoped. I'll use personal inhalers and not diffusers for the safety of my pets.

The Plant Therapy lavender worked wonders. After she ran out she went to the store and found a different brand. She found that brand didn't smell as good or strong. So to always try to encourage people to use quality essential oils (and not ones that are fragrance oils) I bought a bottle for her. And this is the only lavender that I've been using for at least 5 years because I too think it has a wonderful smell and I know it works wonders!

I love the smell and find it so relaxing. I purchased the 100ml bottle and found the dropper (just the normal dispenser that gives you drops) to be a bit defective but still functional and a non issue in my world. The oil seems to come out the side instead of the centre hole. My 4 year old son loves the smell of this as well. My 6 year old daughter not so much but she prefers fruity not floral. Will purchase again!
