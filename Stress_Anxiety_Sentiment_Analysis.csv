The scent was so strong that I can smell it through the bottle and I just knew in my heart that this would be a disappointment. But I still wanted to try it out and to my surprise I actually ended up enjoying the Lavender Essential Oil. I struggle with falling asleep in a timely fashion so I used a cotton ball and just dabbed a drop or two on the back of my pillow and the aroma really did help sooth and relax me. Now I will say this, a major key will be to only use a little. The saying a little goes a long way applies really well with use of this product because over using can come off too strong. I also appreciate the fact that it is kid safe when diluted with water if you have a household with little ones.

IÕve used many lavender and essential oils over the years to try and treat her skin naturally. I was delighted by the quality of this oil, it has a very pleasant, relaxing scent and leaves no residue. Upon opening the bottle the scent took over the room and I felt like I was at a luxury spa. I used this along with a few drops of tea tree oil in my daughter's bath to help sooth her skin after a long day at the pool, and she slept through the night without waking due to itching and skin irritation that is caused by exposure to the chlorine. This oil has so many uses. I put a couple of drops in coconut oil as a hair mask for my dry scalp. Used it treat mosquito bites on my whole family and am also using it as a natural bug repellent.

I poured two drops of the oil on a cotton ball and spread the lavender oil on my sons pillow. I was pretty shockes that it took him a shorter amount of time to fall asleep. Which as a mom it is such a great a relief when our children fall asleep without fighting. I even poured a few drops onto the AC filter in my room after finding the suggestion online. As soon as I tirned the AC on the lavender smell was so refreshing and soothing. I could honestly say that I had a goodnights sleep with the scent of the lavender blowing through the AC.

Before a diffuser, I was using a nontoxic based essential oil lavender candle. So I have a high expectations when it comes to other lavender products. I was a little nervous that this wouldnÕt smell exactly how I expect lavender to smell, only because IÕve had that experience before with other things. Luckily, this essential oil from the bottle smells as itÕs advertised. I like how it states itÕs Òkid safe.Ó The bottle I got is a good starter size and is made of glass with a plastic top. An added bonus is that they put a purple ÒlavenderÓ label on top of the lid making it easy to identify out of my collection. Surprisingly, none of my other essential oils have this, so I always have to pick them up to see what oil it is. Great job Plant Therapy! On the back, the company even says how your can use your oil (a nice touch). When I pour the oil, it dispenses the drops at a consistent rate and doesnÕt run off the edge like other oils do. Once the lavender is diluted in water and diffused, it provides such a soothing atmosphere that immediately calms my body. The only thing that would make this even better is if it was certified organic. However, this isnÕt a dealbreaker for me and I believe Plant Therapy does have those options of organic.",Positive

I was never fond of the smell of lavender or any other floral scents however this lavender smells good. They help me to relax and calm down whenever I begin to feel anxious. I feel safe using this product versus oils from other companies and I trust it to use around children. I am on my third bottle and will be purchasing a larger bottle since I do use it a lot. This oil is great for relaxing you after a long day at times when you feel stressed or whenever you need help falling asleep. I definitely recommend!,Positive

This oil has a pungent almost sour quality to it that made it hard for me to relax and enjoy the scent. It is still somewhat relaxing but because I dont enjoy the smell it doesnt make me feel content and at ease. This is Bulgarian lavender and Ive read that lavender from other countries like Hungary or Greece smell lighter so that may have been the kind of lavender I remember loving. I also did some research and found out that most lavender-scented products like lotions and candles smell much different than pure lavender oil. The lavender essential oil I had from a lower quality brand had a milder more flowery scent that I enjoyed more but I think this one is the better choice since its higher quality.,Positive

The calming effect when used in aromatherapy is amazing. I let the scent in my area calm me soothe the emotions that seemingly are destroying the good day and then I realize the reason is the Lavender Oil in my diffuser. I was never a big believer in that before-back just a few years ago-but when you allow the aroma diffuser to do its thing you can better do yours.
